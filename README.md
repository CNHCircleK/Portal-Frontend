# Portal

A web application intended to replace the CNH Circle K Monthly Report Form submission process that is currently handled through Excel sheets and email. Data shall be centralized, accessible by a back-end API, authorized only for CNH Circle K members.

## NPM Scripts

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Documentation

The /documentation folder contains an Angular breakdown generated by Compodoc. Open as a webpage to see things such as module structure, components, directives, routes, etc.

### Back-end Integration

The front-end of the portal interacts with [the back-end that handles data storage](https://github.com/CNHCircleK/Online-MRF/tree/master/routes). This current commit of the front-end corresponds to the commit f95c9c1 (March 4) on the back-end. We probably should have organized versioning and coupling a bit better.

### Structure

As a high-level overview compared to Compodoc's generated documentation, the general structure of the project is as follows:
 
    .
    ├── assets/Mockups			# Mockups for UI/UX
    ├── dist 					# Distribution files (`ng build --prod` to generate)
    ├── e2e						# End-2-end testing stuff. Haven't actually touched
    ├── documentation 			# Compodoc's generated documentation (`npm run compodoc` to generate)
   	├── src 					# Source files for the whole project
    │   ├── app 					# Meat of the app (`@app/...`)
    │	│	├── core 					# Main project module: other modules, reusable guards/services/directives/etc.
    │	│	├── modules					# Define modules here (current actually just separate components, no modules yet)
    │	│	├── app.component 			# Defines main app component (i.e. all components actually rendered thru here)
    │	│	└── app.module.ts 			# Actual main module defined by Angular (bootstrapped to the project)
    │   ├── assets					# Project assets (`@assets/...`)
    │   ├── environments			# Environment stuff. I defined api_config for ease of use (`@env/...`)
    │	├── styles 					# Project/global styles (e.g. customizing Angular material)
    │	├── themes					# Define themes to be used in SASS files here (`@themes/...`)
    │	├── index.html 				# Blank template, Angular project bootstraped by main.ts
    │	└── other files 			# Angular stuff?
    └── etc.					# Check out Angular and NPM stuff (angular.json, package.json)

### Next Steps

Before more API updates and implementing new things, some plans I haven't finished yet:

:point_right: Finish restructuring services and data in a Typescript way (classes, encapsulated component-instanced services)
:point_right: Create actual modules for lazy-loading and cleanliness (looking a Compodoc's module structure...)
:point_right: Member ID piping (present member name on the form but internally store their ID? Note members with same name)
:point_right: Signup/login end-to-end tuning (e.g. signing up should automatically login OR route to login page)
:point_right: MRF events table + imported events (right now it displays... nothing)
:point_right: Display author in CERFs list table and change CERF status display (i.e. "Draft" or "Submitted") depending on if user is secretary or not
:point_right: Connect Administration tab to the backend
:point_right: Finish Clubs and Divisions tabs for LTGs and District Secretary respectively (i.e. making clubs/divisions, appointing LTGs/presidents)
:point_right: MRF List view for Secretaries, LTGs, and District Secretaries (i.e. LTGs should be able to see latest MRF from all clubs in division OR navigate by club)

### Future Implementations

TBD
